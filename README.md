# UT Course Registration

A Chrome extension that enhances course catalog searches for UT Austin students.

This extension converts multiple pages of course search results into one long scrollable page.

I may add more features if you request one. You can also contribute your own features.


## Chrome Web Store

The extension can be installed to chrome from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ut-course-registration/icagkmmhiniojljnjbhpmfjpekjgeddi).
